#Specifying Software

##In the Beginning...
When we want to specify software, there are a range of items we might want to consider:
- **OS the software is to run on**: Think about who your target customers are, and what OS they are already using. Also think about when your users would want to use their software. At home (so maybe go with Mac or Windows) or on the go (iOS or Android)?
- **Feature list**: What features are most essential to your customers’ interest in the product? These may be the features you look to include in your Minimal Viable Product (MVP).
- Other functional software specifications (ex. how quickly does the software need to run?)
- Non-functional software specifications (ex. how should the UI look and feel?)
- Business goals
- What others can you think of?

##Big Design Upfront vs. Incremental Development
As you can see from the previous section, there can be a laundry list of considerations when we set out to specify our software. Many traditional organizations attempt to codify all of these at the outset of a project. We call this 'big design upfront.'

The problem with big design upfront is that it forces you to make detailed decisions about how to build your software when you know the least about the complications you may encounter, and the tradeoffs you'll have to make. The solution is incremental development, where software is built over time in small increments of working code with regular demo days. Incremental development allows the project to adapt to business changes quickly, minimizing execution risk. You can read more about incremental development [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_build_model)

##Managing Incremental Development
Incremental development can be managed with user stories and regular demos.

Instead of big design upfront, we opt for 'specification by example,' where we come up with short stories describing the goals a user might want to achieve in using our software, and then handle all development to deliver on particular stories instead of tackling the entire project at once. Here is the format of a user story:
> As a **type of user**, I want **some feature**, so that **some benefit**.

As we start incremental development, we can focus on the user stories that are crucial to developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). We keep track of the stories we have completed, and what's still in the pipeline, using a 'kanban' board like the one pictured below
